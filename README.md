My name is William Downs. I taught myself how to program calculators in high school. Then I went to Advanced Missions Training
with Overland Missions. I decide to join them to be a coder in their office. So they taught me how to teach myself to code.
Right now I am learning GitHub and having Git parties. It's been fun. We'll see where my coding adventure goes from here.
